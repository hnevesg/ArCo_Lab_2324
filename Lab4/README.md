# Lab 4: Optimization with openMP
The goal of this lab is to optimize the hyperspectral image compression algorithm HyperLCA using OpenMP ([Link](HLCA.md)). To achieve this, you will utilize Intel Advisor's threading analysis to facilitate parallelization. As the final outcome, you will have learned how to parallelize code with OpenMP and analyze it using Intel's tools.

# Tasks
This lab is broken into various tasks, and for each of them, the student should respond to a set of questions and analyses.


1. Task 1 - **Architecture Analysis and Code Annotation**: This task involves answering general questions regarding the thread parallelization capacity of your machine, as well as preparing the code for analysis. [Link](results/task1/README.md)

2. Tarea 2 - **Threading Analysis**: In this task, a threading analysis will be conducted, and general questions about the results will be addressed. [Link](results/task2/README.md)

3. Tarea 3 - **Code Parallelization with OpenMP**: Based on the analysis information, the code will be parallelized using OpenMP. [Link](results/task3/README.md)
