# Lab 3: Vectorization
The objective of this laboratory is to gain practical understanding of the operation and application of vectorization within a program written in C. This will be accomplished through the use of a program designed to compute the multiplication of two arrays of complex numbers (A and B), which will produce a new array that embodies the summation of the elements in A for each element in B. The program will be analyzed following a workflow specific to vectorization.

Upon completion,you will have acquired the skills necessary to vectorize a program and to analyze the enhancements implemented, utilizing Intel's suite of tools.

# Tasks
This lab requires the completion of several tasks, that will imply performing some analysis and answering some questions:

1. Task 1 - **Intel-Advisor y Hardware**: In this task you will answer general questions about Intel Advisor with the aim to provide you with the knowledge to carry on the rest of the tasks. [Enlace](results/task1/README.md)
2. Tasl 2 - **Roofline**: In this task you'll perform a roofline analysis. Then you should be able to understand the information represented in this type of graphics. [Enlace](results/task3/README.md)
3. Task 3 - **Vectorizaci√≥n**: Here you will optimize the program through the use of the SIMD capabilities of OpemMP.  [Enlace](results/task3/README.md)
4. Task 4 - **Memory usage and Vectorization Analysis**: When parallelizing the code it is very important to understand the usage of memory and the different access patterns. In this task you will have to analyze the concrete algorithm tu understand such patterns and obtain a good vetorization result. [Enlace](results/task4/README.md)
